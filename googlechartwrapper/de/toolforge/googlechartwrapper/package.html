Defines the supported charts.
<p>Every chart basically is a collection of features which are collected using the 
FeatureAppender mechansim. Each chart implements a number of interfaces containing the 
methods to add, get and remove features from the chart. </p>

<p>This package also includes the AbstractChart and the two basic enums 
ChartType and ChartTypeFeature. The class AbstractChart implements the basic functionality
of each chart - especially offering the FeatureAppender collection mechanism. 
When generating the final google chart API URL it collects every FeatureAppender
of the (implementing) subclass (its type) and organizes/sorts the content of these 
appenders. These AppendableFeatures are then asked for their detail string which is 
appended to the final API URL.  </p>
